00
==

00 (Double-O) is a proof of concept app to get zeromq and zeroconf living
together in harmony.

I hope to turn it into a library that enables the building of simple zeromq
services and clients that can then be chained in interesting ways

Once you have installed the relevent packages (see the deployment directory)
you can run the requester and responder in seperate terminals:

> python auto_responder.py

> python auto_requester.py
